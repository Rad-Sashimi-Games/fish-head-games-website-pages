### Intro Cutscene

The game begins by showing an opening cinematic to the player. In this cinematic, a knock is heard on the players door. Through a first person view, the player gets up from their desk and walks over towards their bedroom door. When they open the door they find a fish tank at the foot of the door with a sticky note from their friend Lonnie. 

The sticky note reads: "I got a little something for ya pal! Hope you enjoy it!" After briefly reading the sticky note, the player picks up the fish tank, and shifts it onto their desk, clearing things in the way in order to make room for the tank. Now the player actively looks into the tank and sees an excited little fish swimming around in circles with a big ol fish smile on its face.


> [!NOTE] Fun Fact
> The fish shown in this introduction is also randomized and is a nice little unique preview of the possible fish that the player can get. At the beginning of the game, if there is no save data, this actually becomes the player's first fish. In subsequent play throughs however, this becomes any random fish that might be obtained by the gachapon.

After bow the happy little fish, the camera pans out to show a full view of the room with the fish tank on the desk and fades to black.

### Title Screen / Main Menu

The title screen of the game opens up with a menu overlayed on top a camera that is slowly revolving around the players current fish tank. The fish tank cannot be interacted with in this view, but provides a nice preview of the player's progress, while allowing them to do main menu things.
